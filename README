# REPL-y

A fitter, happier, more productive REPL for Clojure.

## Improvements over the existing REPL
- allows a number of readline commands:
  - jumping to the start/end of lines
  - jumping forward/back by word (not available in JLine versions before 2)
  - history searching
  - and much much more
- CTRL-C doesn't bail out of the process; just cancels the current command
- code completion for vars

## Coming soon
- hold full source code of in-repl defns in metadata?
- code completion for:
  - namespaces
  - Java classes & packages

## Maybe one day
- indentation
- colorization
- code completion for:
  - Java methods (maybe on type-hinted clojure vars?)

## Installation

I'm hoping this will eventually be distributed with Russ Olsen's excellent
[dejour](https://github.com/russolsen/dejour.git).

Meantime (assuming you have
[leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen.git) installed):

    git clone https://github.com/trptcolin/reply.git
    cd reply
    lein deps, compile

## Usage

Run `bin/reply.sh`. This will get friendlier for non-Cygwin Windows users.

## Thanks

Thanks to the Clojure and JLine developers for their work on the
excellent projects that this project depends upon.

Special thanks to [8th Light](http://8thlight.com) for paying me to work on
this during our open-source Friday afternoons.
